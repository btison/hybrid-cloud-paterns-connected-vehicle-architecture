A) Currently the demo needs the two domains:
	1. apps.bandini-hub.blueprints.redhat.com (ocpDomain)
	2. api.bandini-hub.blueprints.redhat.com (ocpApi)

1. is done by setting  ocpDomain to hubClusterDomain variable.
For 2. I am doing a `replace "apps." "api."` of `ocpDomain`, that is likely suboptimal.
Am I guaranteed it is called api. ?
I need to figure out how we can fetch it programmatically first
